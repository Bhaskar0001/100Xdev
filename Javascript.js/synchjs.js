//i/o heavy...I/O (Input/Output) heavy operations refer to tasks in a
//  computer program that involve a lot of data
//   transfer between the program and external 
//   systems or devices. These operations usually require waiting for data to be read from or written to sources 
//   like disks, networks, databases, or other external devices, which can be time-consuming 
//   compared to in-memory computations.
//ex are reading file and https request
// const fs =require('fs');//synchronous
// const contents=fs.readFileSync('a.txt','utf8');//bytes,hex form
// console.log(contents);

// const data=fs.readFileSync('b.txt','utf8');//synchronous
// console.log(data);

// const content=fs.readFile('a.txt','utf8');//asynchronous
// console.log(content);
